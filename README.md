# Quipper 

**Note:** *<2020-01-08>* The release of Quipper v0.9 and its inclusion [on Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/quipper) makes this repository obsolete. It is kept online to prevent breaking software using this version. Please use the most recent version of Quipper available for a new project.

This is a copy of the [Quipper language v0.8](https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/quipper/) with some minor modifications so that it is compatible with `stack` and has the QuipperLib libraries.

I used this for the development of [the code](https://github.com/mx-psi/quantum-algorithms/) that I developed for [my undergraduate dissertation](https://github.com/mx-psi/tfg).
